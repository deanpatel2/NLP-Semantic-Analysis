# Venture-Semantic-Analysis

This is a semantic analysis project which is aimed at generating value from the past 12 years of feedback on ventures for [IDEA](https://www.northeastern.edu/idea/), one of the largest student-led venture accelerators in the nation.

The venture team has asked us (the data team) to characterize the commonalities in the feedback of those ventures which make it into further stages in the launch process and eventually receive funding.

### Tools Used: VADER

VADER is a sentiment analysis tool which allows you to describe the polarity of natural language and is particularly well-tuned to feedback data (short, few sentences entries). In this project, I am working on using sentiment analysis to interrogate the feedback on a more quantitative level. In the future, using sentiment scores may be one of several features in a model to classify the similarities of ventures and potentially predict issues they may have in the launch process.
